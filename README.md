# QUERY-AND-RETRIEVAL-SYSTEM-FOR-TERRORISM-DATABASE
I am trying to create a database that retrieves the information of all the terrorist attacks such as the people involved (i.e. the leader and the terrorist group), the location and the date and time of each attack. The database created is in a form of search engine that uses retrieval algorithms like Positional Indexing, Inverted indexing, Signature files as well as clustering based algorithms to retrieve the specified query.
These retrieval algorithms are implemented over a dataset that has nearly 190,000 rows and 135 columns. After the preprocessing part, the main task was to make every single row of the database as a single document and then tokenize them so that we get relevant and specific information of all the data points present in the dataset. After breaking down the dataset, the proposed algorithms (mentioned above) are then implemented. During the process of implementation we broke down the dataset in 5000 documents so as for the smooth working of the python code according to the machine specifications.
